Spring AOP : Aspect Oriented Programming :

Procedure Language 

Limitation of Procedure Oriented Programming language 
In Procedure oriented language we will focus more than functionality or coding rather 
than properties or state.

Object oriented langauge we will focus on properties or state. 

AOP focus on functionality. 

generally while writing functionality or logic the code divided into two parts. 
1. core functionality or primary functionality or atual coding for that application.  
2.  secondary functionality or the functionality which is common on all application or 
which will support to develop the application or cross cutting is known as secondary functionality 
according to AOP. 


	Banking application 
	1.checkBalance 
	2. transfer the amount 
	3. withdraw 
	4. deposit 
	
	etc 

	Secondary functionality 
	1. login 
	2. database connectivity 
	3. security 
	4. validation 
		
	etc 

	AOP allow separation of the cross cutting concern. 

	These are cross cutting concern are different from the main business functionality.
